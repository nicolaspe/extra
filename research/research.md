## Software

#### Processing (with video library)
- [Link](https://processing.org/)

mov files + `img.scale`

Cannot load videos from a parent folder. Ex: `"../media/filename.mp4"`, they can only be loaded from `"/data/filename.mp4"` and the data folder does not have to be written on the code (`new Movie(this, "filename.mp4")`)

[disable movie sound documentation](https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/how-disable-sound-in-movie.html): has to be user AFTER the video is started/looped. Volume range 0-1. Stops working after first time?

resize does not work well on video frames... use code from the Frames example
